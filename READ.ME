
Example application showing super hero database.

The purpose of this application is to show usage of some basic libraries and architecture concepts:
- Clean architecture
- MVVM,
- Data binding,
- rxKotlin
- LiveData (Just as an example, for consistency real project should use RxLiveData or https://github.com/JakeWharton/RxBinding)
- Lottie
- Glide
- FastAdapter

Further developement should be focused on:
- Unit tests
- detect
- Support for animations and transitions.
