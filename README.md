The purpose of this application is to show usage of some basic libraries and architecture concepts:
* Clean architecture
* MVVM
* Data binding
* rxKotlin
* LiveData (Just as an example, for consistency real project should use RxLiveData or https://github.com/JakeWharton/RxBinding)
* Lottie
* Glide
* FastAdapter
